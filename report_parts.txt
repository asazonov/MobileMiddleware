As described in the brief, the sensor data producer is deployed on a mobile device. This dictated a number of constraints that had to be considered while developing the system.

The technologies used to develop the producer had to be easy to deploy on a mobile device. In recent years, it has become increasingly popular to develop mobile web apps – applications that use device's browser as the execution environment. Such applications have an advantage of being easy to distribute and deploy on various platforms. HTML5 and Javascript, used to develop web apps, provide rich APIs for accessing sensor data – accelerometers, audio, video, etc. Thus, the project aimed to utilise technologies that are supported by browsers of modern mobile platforms. 

Webockets –  

WAMP

Autobahn.py and Twisted were used 


POST

"Requests" library was used to send GET requests to the registry by the producer and the client. Flask framework was used to serve (?) by the registry.
